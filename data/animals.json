They also eat sea birds and ducks or hunt over grasslands and marshes for small mammals such as rabbits, squirrels, prairie dogs and muskrats. Bald eagles eat carrion willingly and are notorious for robbing osprey of their catches. Eagles wait on a favorite perch for an osprey to return to its nest with a fish in its talons for its own young, and then harass the smaller raptor until it is forced to drop its prey for the eagle to retrieve. When hunting for fishes, it does not usually dive into the water like the osprey but instead searches for fish near the surface.The bald eagle's diet at the Smithsonian's National Zoo consists of rats, fish, chicken leg quarters and quail.",

The four families are the Psittaculidae (Old World parrots), Psittacidae (African and New World parrots), Cacatuidae (cockatoos), and Strigopidae (New Zealand parrots). One-third of all parrot species are threatened by extinction, with a higher aggregate extinction risk (IUCN Red List Index) than any other comparable bird group.

      "Physical Description": "Both males and females have an \"armored\" body with a muscular, flat tail. The skin on their back is armored with embedded bony plates called osteoderms or scutes. They have four short legs; the front legs have five toes while the back legs have only four toes. Alligators have a long, rounded snout that has upward facing nostrils at the end; this allows breathing to occur while the rest of the body is underwater. The young have bright yellow stripes on the tail; adults have dark stripes on the tail.It's easy to distinguish an alligator from a crocodile by the teeth. The large, fourth tooth in the lower jaw of an alligator fits into a socket in the upper jaw and is not visible when the mouth is closed. This does not happen in crocodiles. Alligators have between 74 and 80 teeth in their mouth at a time. As they wear down, they are replaced. An alligator can go through 3,000 teeth in a lifetime.",
      "Lifespan": "American alligators live about 50 years in the wild. After they are 4 feet long, alligators are safe from predators except humans and occasionally other alligators.",
      "Food/Eating Habits": "Alligators are carnivorous. They have very strong jaws that can crack a turtle shell. They eat fish, snails and other invertebrates, birds, frogs and mammals that come to the water's edge. They use their sharp teeth to seize and hold prey. They swallow small prey whole. If the prey is large, they shake it apart into smaller, manageable pieces. If it is very large, they will bite it, then spin on the long axis of their bodies to tear off easily swallowed pieces.At the Smithsonian's National Zoo, American alligators are fed rats and occasionally rabbits.",
      "Social Structure": "Female alligators usually remain in a small area. Males can occupy areas greater than two square miles. Both males and females extend their ranges during the breeding season. Young alligators remain in the area where they are hatched and where their mother protects them. After two to three years, they leave that area in search of food or when driven out by larger alligators.",

    "traits": {
      "Physical Description": "Tigers have reddish-orange coats with\u00a0prominent black stripes, white bellies and white spots on their ears. Like a human fingerprint, no two tigers have the exact same markings. Because of this, researchers can use stripe patterns to identify different individuals when studying tigers in the wild. Tigers are powerful hunters with sharp teeth, strong jaws and agile bodies. They are the largest terrestrial mammal whose diet consists entirely of meat; the largest tiger ever recorded was an Amur tiger. The tiger's closest relative is the lion. In fact, without fur, it is difficult to distinguish a tiger from a lion.",
      "Lifespan": "The life span of tigers in the wild is usually between 10 and 15 years. In human care, or on rare occasions in the wild, a tiger can live up to 20 years. However, approximately half of all wild tiger cubs do not survive past the first two years of life. Only 40 percent of those that reach independence actually live to establish a territory and produce young. The risk of mortality remains high for adult tigers due to their territorial nature, which often results in direct competition with conspecifics, or members of the same species.",
      "Food/Eating Habits": "Tigers are ambush predators that rely on stealth and strength to take down prey.\u00a0These apex predators primarily hunt large ungulates, such as wild boar\u00a0and deer, but are also known to consume\u00a0monkeys, buffalo, sloth bears, leopards and even crocodiles. When tigers are found in close proximity to humans, they may also feed on domestic animals, such as cattle or goats. Tigers are adept swimmers and have even been recorded hunting in the water.These powerful cats hunt primarily at night, using sight and sound to identify prey. Their striped coats help them blend into their surroundings, where they lie in wait for prey to pass by. At the opportune moment, tigers pounce on their prey, take it to the ground and finish the kill by breaking or biting the neck. Tigers hunt about once a week and consume as much as 75 pounds (34 kilograms) of food in one night.At the Zoo, tigers eat ground beef, and their diet is supplemented with enrichment items each week. They receive knucklebones or cow femurs twice a week and rabbits once a week to exercise their jaws and keep their teeth healthy.",
      "Social Structure": "Tigers in the wild are thought to be solitary creatures, except when mating or raising young. Cubs stay with their mothers until they learn to hunt successfully, usually at about 18 to 24 months old. They reach full independence after two to three years, at which point they disperse to find their own territory. Female tigers often remain near their mother's' territory, while males disperse farther from home.",

    "traits": {
      "Physical Description": "North American beavers have stocky bodies with a yellow-brown to almost black coat and a broad, flat, scaly tail. Their large, orange incisors grow continuously throughout their lifetime. They have\u00a0webbed rear feet and digitated front paws. The beaver's stocky body enables it to conserve heat.Beavers have long, orange, visible front teeth, called incisors.\u00a0These teeth grow continuously throughout its life and are worn down through daily use. These teeth are self-sharpening and can cut a tree the size of a person's finger in a single bite! If the incisors become too long, they can prevent the beaver's mouth from closing enough for its grinding molars to meet, which could lead to starvation. Beavers' incisors appear dark orange due to the high amount of iron contained in the enamel, which is the hard outer layer of the teeth. The iron strengthens the enamel, helping prevent the teeth from breaking or cracking while the beaver gnaws.Beavers regularly move between aquatic and terrestrial environments. Their small, dexterous front feet are well adapted to working on land. They walk on five digits, grasp sticks with their front paws and have well-developed digging claws. Their larger hind feet are webbed for swimming and void of fur, except on the dorsal surface.The hind feet also have a preening toe, the second from the inside, with a unique double toenail. Beavers are meticulous groomers. They use the preening toe as a comb to\u00a0prevent\u00a0their fine, soft fur from matting to\u00a0maintain its waterproofing and insulating properties. These flexible toes also remove burrs and parasites.On land, a beaver's movements\u00a0are extremely awkward, making them vulnerable to predators. In water, however, beavers can swim up to 6 mph (10 kilometers per hour). Their oversized lungs allow them to stay submerged for up to 15 minutes while traveling over half a mile.Whiskers help detect objects around a beaver's face and head, which is especially helpful in narrow passageways and dark water. The beaver's eyes have a thin, transparent membrane, called a\u00a0nictitating membrane, which is pulled over the eyeball for underwater work. A beaver's sight is good only for short distances and at close range. Its ears are external, small and rounded, with valves that also close while submerged, and the beaver's auditory sense is well developed.The shape of the\u00a0tail is an individual and family trait, varying\u00a0from short and broad to long and narrow. It is practically hairless and covered with black scales. There is a sharp demarcation between the fur and the scales, the fur remaining at full length and density right up to this line. The tail is used as a rudder in swimming, as a balance prop while working on land and to signal danger when slapped on the water. Beavers will also store fat in their tails, eating more in the fall so they can survive off the fat stored in their tails through winter if food is not available. The beaver's vertebrae continue into and almost to the end of the tail.",
      "Lifespan": "North American beavers typically live 10 to 12\u00a0years. The oldest on record lived\u00a030 years in human care.",
      "Food/Eating Habits": "Beavers are herbivores, eating leaves, woody stems and aquatic plants. Their chief building materials are also their preferred foods: poplar, aspen, willow, birch and maple.In cold climates, they spend the winter inside their lodge chamber, feeding on branches they have stored on the muddy pond floor as a winter food supply. The water acts as a refrigerator, keeping the stems cold and preserving the nutritional value. Beavers hold their food with their front paws, eating corn-on-the-cob style.At the Smithsonian's National Zoo, they eat\u00a0mixed vegetables, rodent chow, leafy greens and a healthy supply of wood.",
      "Social Structure": "Beavers form strong family bonds. They are social animals, and each group is made up of one breeding pair, the year's kits\u00a0and the surviving offspring from the previous year, called yearlings.There may also may be one or more sub-adults, 2 years or older, of either sex from previous breeding seasons. These subadults generally do not breed.In winter, these family groups\u00a0live together in their lodge and share food from the common larder (stored food supply). Their family life is exceptionally stable and is based on a hierarchy in which adults dominate yearlings and yearlings dominate kits. Physical aggression is rare and vocalizations, gestures and postures are used within the lodge to communicate issues of dominance status within the group.",

      "Lifespan": "American flamingos have a lifespan of about 40-60 years.",
      "Food/Eating Habits": "These flamingos eat algae, small seeds and aquatic invertebrates such as brine, fly larvae, shrimp and mollusks. Flamingos usually feed while wading in shallows, using their feet to stir up mud on the bottom. They put their head to the surface (so that the bill is upside-down, with the tip\u00a0pointing\u00a0backward) and sweeps their head from side to side.By a rapid action of the tongue, they pump water in and out of the slightly opened bill. The way in which the upper and lower parts of the bill fit together, combined with the comb-like plates on the bill's edges, make it a useful tool for sieving food from water.",

They have white caps on their heads, leading to their nickname: \u201cbaldpate.\u201d When in flight, the male shows off stark white markings on his stomach, under his wings, and on his backside. Females have more subtle plumage, with warm brown feathers all over and a dark smoky eye. Both males and females have short, pale beaks.",
      "Lifespan": "The oldest recorded American wigeon lived for 21 years. They typically live for 2-3 years in the wild.",
      "Food/Eating Habits": "Wigeons eat mainly plants and other vegetation, either in or out of the water. While feeding in ponds, lakes\u00a0and salt water, they nibble on aquatic plants like the upper parts of wigeon grass (named for them), duck sedge, duckweed\u00a0and cattails.Their short, sturdy bills help them pluck plants forcefully, allowing them to graze on land easier than other ducks do. They eat grasses and seeds.In the breeding season, they eat more protein,\u00a0including insects and small aquatic invertebrates like caddisflies, damselflies, midges, beetles, mollusks and crawdads.",
      "Social Structure": "In the winter, they form big flocks with other waterfowl, including mallards, coots and other kinds of ducks. As spring gets closer, males begin competing for females, chasing them and threatening other males. Courtship displays include posturing and whistles. After mating, wigeons take a few weeks to molt before beginning their annual fall migration.",

    "traits": {
      "Physical Description": "The giant panda, a black-and-white bear, has a body typical of bears. It has black fur on its ears, eye patches, muzzle, legs, and shoulders. The rest of the animal's coat is white. Although scientists do not know why these unusual bears are black and white, some speculate that the bold coloring provides effective camouflage. In patches of dense bamboo, an immobile giant panda is nearly invisible, and virtually disappears among snow covered rocky outcrops on a mountain slope. This theory does not work, however, when considering that giant pandas have no natural enemies to hide from. Another thought is that the pattern may accentuate social signals in some way, or help giant pandas to identify one another from a distance so they can avoid socializing, as they are typically a solitary animal. Another theory suggests that the black absorbs heat while the white reflects it, helping giant pandas maintain an even temperature. Unfortunately, there is no one conclusive theory as to why giant pandas are black and white.The giant panda has lived in bamboo forests for several million years. It is a highly specialized animal, with unique adaptations. The panda's thick, wooly coat keeps it warm in the cool forests of its habitat. Giant pandas have large molar teeth and strong jaw muscles for crushing tough bamboo. Many people find these chunky, lumbering animals to be cute, but giant pandas can be as dangerous as any other bear.",
      "Lifespan": "Scientists are not sure how long giant pandas live in the wild, but they are sure it is\u00a0shorter than lifespans in zoos. They estimate that\u00a0lifespan\u00a0is about 15-20 years for wild pandas and about 30 years for those in human care. Chinese scientists have reported zoo pandas as old as 35. The Smithsonian National Zoo's Hsing-Hsing died at age 28 in 1999.",
      "Food/Eating Habits": "Millions of Zoo visitors enjoy watching giant pandas eat. A panda usually eats while sitting upright, in a pose that resembles how humans sit on the floor. This posture leaves the front paws free to grasp bamboo stems with the help of a \"pseudo thumb,\" formed by an elongated and enlarged wrist bone covered with a fleshy pad of skin. The panda also uses its powerful jaws and strong teeth to crush the tough, fibrous bamboo into bits.A giant panda's digestive system is more similar to that of a carnivore than an herbivore, and so much of what is eaten is passed as waste. To make up for the inefficient digestion, a panda needs to consume a comparatively large amount of food\u2014from 70\u00a0to 100\u00a0pounds of bamboo each day\u2014to get all its nutrients. To obtain this much food means that a panda must spend 10 to 16 hours a day foraging and eating. The rest of its time is spent mostly sleeping and resting.",
      "Social Structure": "Adult giant pandas may be generally solitary, but they do communicate periodically through scent marks, calls\u00a0and occasional meetings. Recent research has also found that giant pandas may form communities of seven to 15 individuals within the local population.These individuals occupy a \"group\" territory, within which male home ranges overlap almost completely, while female home ranges overlap far less. Members of different \"groups\" generally avoid socializing with each other. Offspring stay with their mothers from one and a half to three years.",

    "name": "Western lowland gorilla",
    "species": "Class:MammaliaOrder:PrimatesFamily:HominidaeGenus and Species:Gorilla gorilla gorilla",
    "description": "Now more than ever, we need your support. Make a donation to the Smithsonian's National Zoo and Conservation Biology Institute today!",
    "traits": {
      "Physical Description": "The gorilla's coat color is black. Short, thin, gray-black to brown-black hair covers the entire body except the face. Western lowland gorillas may have a more brownish coloration. A small white tuft of hair on their rump distinguishes infants up to four years old. The white patch helps the mother keep track of the infant and assists other group members in identifying the gorilla as an infant.Mature silverback males have a saddle of white hair across the small of their backs. In western lowland gorillas, the silver may extend to rump and thighs. Western lowland females may go gray below the ears and on the neck and top of the head as they age. Compared to other subspecies, western lowland gorillas have a more pronounced brow ridge and ears that appear small in relation to their heads. They also have a differently shaped nose and lip than other subspecies.Adult male gorillas' heads look conical due to the large bony crests on the top and back of the skull. These crests anchor the massive muscles used to support and operate their large jaws and teeth. Adult female gorillas also have these crests, but they are much less pronounced.In comparison to the mountain gorilla, the western lowland gorilla has a wider and larger skull, and their big toe is spread apart more from the alignment of the other four toes. Gorillas' arms are longer than their legs; when they move on all fours, they knuckle-walk, supporting their weight on the third and fourth digits of their curled hands. Like other primates, each individual has distinctive fingerprints. Gorillas also have unique nose prints.",
      "Lifespan": "In the wild, gorillas live for 30 or 40 years. In human care, gorillas may live into their 50s.",
      "Food/Eating Habits": "Gorillas are primarily herbivorous, eating the leaves and stems of herbs, shrubs and vines. They also eat the fleshy fruits of close to a hundred seasonally fruiting tree species. Other gorilla subspecies eat proportionally less fruit. Gorillas get some protein from invertebrates found on leaves and fruits. Adult male gorillas eat about 45 pounds (32 kilograms) of food per day. Females eat about two-thirds of that amount.At the Smithsonian's National Zoo, the group is fed together in the morning. Food items are cut up and spread over a wide area. In the summer, this is usually done in the yard. In the afternoon, individuals are separated so each animal gets its share of preferred food items. Morning and evening foods include chow, greens, fruits and vegetables.Forage items placed in hay for the gorillas include popcorn, sunflower seeds, peanuts, \"enrich bits,\" beans and diced fruits and vegetables. Fresh tree trimmings are given daily. Some of the gorillas favorite browse; options are Bradford pear, willow, mulberry with berries and maple.There are three feeding behaviors sometimes observed in gorillas in human care that can bother visitors. These behaviors are natural, though not to humans. They are regurgitation and reingestion, coprophagy (eating feces) and urine drinking. Regurgitation and reingestion involves an animal regurgitating some of its food and re-eating it. Biologists do not entirely understand why gorillas exhibit this behavior in human care.A few ideas include starch or sugar content, mineral recapture or the food tasting good. Provision of forage foods, increased smaller feedings and providing browse seem to reduce this behavior in some individuals. Coprophagy is seen in the wild and is defined as the eating of feces. Gorillas do not have very efficient digestive systems for a high fiber diet, so unprocessed food can be found in their feces. Coprophagy allows an animal to utilize this food. Similarly, urine drinking might be explained as the recollection of minerals.",
      "Social Structure": "Gorillas are flexible in their nature and behavior. Thus, the information found here is only a general guide.Gorillas live in groups, or troops, from two to over 30 members. But data seems to indicate that western lowland gorillas live in smaller groups, averaging about five individuals. Groups are generally composed of a silverback male, one or more black back males, several adult females and their infant and juvenile offspring. This group composition varies greatly due to births, deaths and the immigration and emigration of individuals.Mature offspring typically leave their birth group to find a mate. At about eight years old, females generally emigrate into a new group of their choosing. They seem to choose which silverback to join based on such attributes as size and quality of his home range.A female may change family groups a number of times throughout her life. When leaving their birth group, some sexually mature males may attempt to replace the silverback in an already established group. However, they usually spend a few years as bachelor males. Nevertheless, a new troop can be easily formed when one or more non-related females join a lone male.An adult, dominant, silverback males leads the group. He has exclusive breeding rights to the females though at times, he may allow other sub-adult males in the group to mate with females. The silverback mediates disputes and also determines the group's home range. He regulates what time they wake up, eat and go to sleep.All gorillas over three years of age make both day nests for resting and night nests for sleeping. Infants share their mothers' nests. Gorillas form nests by sitting in one place and pulling down and tucking branches, leaves or other vegetation around themselves. Adult males usually nest on the ground. Females may nest on the ground or in trees. Juveniles are more apt to nest in trees. Studies of western lowland gorillas have shown that the number of nests found at a site does not necessarily coincide with the number of weaned animals observed in a group.The western lowland gorilla is a quiet, peaceful and non-aggressive animal. It never attacks unless provoked. However, males do fight over females, and the new leader of a group may kill unrelated infants. This causes the females to begin cycling sooner. An adult male protecting his group may attempt to intimidate his aggressor by standing on his legs and slapping its chest with cupped or flat hands while roaring and screaming.If this elaborate display is unsuccessful and the intruder persists, the male may rear his head back violently several times. He may also drop on all fours and charge toward the intruder. In general, when they charge they do not hit the intruder. Instead, they merely pass them by. This display of aggression maintains order among separate troops and reduces the possibility of injury. It is thought that size plays an important role in determining the winner of an encounter between males, with the larger male winning.Gorillas exhibit complex and dynamic relationships. They interact using grooming behaviors, although less than most other primates. Affiliation may also be shown through physical proximity. Young gorillas play often and are more arboreal than the large adults. Adults, even the silverback, tolerate infant play behavior. He also tolerates and often participates in the play of older juveniles and black back males. Because of gorilla variability, some or all of these behaviors may or may not be seen.",

      "": "",
      "Physical Description": "Komodo dragons are large lizards with long tails, strong and agile necks, and sturdy limbs. Their tongues are yellow and forked. Adults are an almost-uniform stone color\u00a0with distinct, large scales, while juveniles may display a more vibrant color and pattern.The muscles of the Komodo's jaws and throat allow it to swallow huge chunks of meat with astonishing rapidity. Several movable joints, such as the intramandibular hinge opens the lower jaw unusually wide. The stomach expands easily, enabling an adult to consume up to 80 percent of its own body weight in a single meal, which most likely explains some exaggerated claims for immense weights in captured individuals. When threatened, Komodos can throw up the contents of their stomachs to lessen their weight in order to flee.Although males tend to grow larger and bulkier than females, no obvious morphological differences mark the sexes. One subtle clue does exist: a slight difference in the arrangement of scales just in front of the cloaca. Sexing Komodos remains a challenge for human researchers; the dragons themselves appear to have little trouble figuring out who is who.",
      "Lifespan": "Komodo dragons live about 30 years in the wild, but scientists are still studying this.",
      "Food/Eating Habits": "Komodo\u00a0dragons eat almost any kind of meat, scavenging for carcasses or stalking animals that range in size from small rodents to large water buffalo. Young feed primarily on small lizards and insects, as well as snakes and birds. If they live to be 5 years old, they move onto larger prey, such as rodents, monkeys, goats, wild boars and deer (the most popular meal). These reptiles are tertiary predators\u00a0at the top of their food chain\u00a0and are also cannibalistic.Although the Komodo dragon can briefly reach speeds of 10 to 13 mph (16 to 20 kph), its hunting strategy is based on stealth and power. It can spend hours in one spot along a game trail \u2014 waiting for a deer\u00a0or other sizable and nutritious prey to cross its path \u2014 before launching an attack.Most of the monitor's attempts at bringing down prey are unsuccessful. However, if it is able to bite its prey, bacteria and venom in its saliva will kill the prey within a few days. After the animal dies, which can take up to four days, the Komodo\u00a0uses its powerful sense of smell to locate the body. A kill is often shared between many Komodo dragons.Monitors can see objects as far away as 985 feet (300 meters), so vision does play a role in hunting, especially as their eyes are better at picking up movement than at discerning stationary objects. Their retinas possess only cones, so they may be able to distinguish color but have poor vision in dim light. They have a much smaller hearing range than humans and, as a result, cannot hear sounds like low-pitched voices or high-pitched screams.The Komodo dragon's sense of smell is its primary food detector. It uses its\u00a0long, yellow, forked tongue to sample\u00a0the air. It then moves the forked tip of its tongue to the roof of its mouth, where it makes contact with the Jacobson's organs. These chemical analyzers \"smell\" prey, such as a deer,\u00a0by recognizing airborne molecules. If the concentration of molecules present on the left tip of the tongue is greater than that sample from the right, the Komodo dragon knows that the deer is approaching from the left.This system, along with an undulatory\u00a0walk, in which the head swings from side to side, helps the dragon sense the existence and direction of food. At times, these reptiles can smell carrion, or rotting flesh, up to 2.5 miles (4 kilometers) away.This lizard's large, curved and serrated teeth are its deadliest weapon, tearing flesh with efficiency. The tooth serrations hold bits of meat from its most recent meal, and this protein-rich residue supports large numbers of bacteria. Some 50 different bacterial strains, at least seven of which are highly septic, have been found in the saliva. Researchers have also documented a venom gland in the dragon's lower jaw. In addition to the harmful bacteria, the\u00a0venom prevents the blood from clotting, which causes massive blood loss and induces shock.The Komodo's bite may be deadly, but not to another Komodo dragon. Those wounded while sparring with each other appear to be unaffected by the bacteria and venom. Scientists are searching for antibodies in Komodo dragon blood that may be responsible.The lizard's throat and neck muscles allow it to rapidly swallow huge chunks of meat. Several movable joints, such as the intramandibular hinge, open its lower jaw unusually wide. The dragon's stomach also easily expands, enabling an adult to consume up to 80 percent of its own body weight in a single meal. When threatened, Komodo dragons can throw up the contents of their stomachs to lessen their weight in order to flee.Komodo dragons are efficient eaters, leaving behind only about 12 percent of their prey. They eat bones, hooves and sections of hide, as well as intestines (after swinging them to dislodge their contents).At the Smithsonian's National Zoo, the\u00a0Komodo dragon eats rodents, chicks and rabbits. Occasionally, he consumes fish and carcass\u00a0meals of beef.",
      "Social Structure": "Because large Komodos cannibalize young ones, the young often roll in fecal material, thereby assuming a scent that the large dragons are programmed to avoid. Young dragons also undergo rituals of appeasement, with the smaller lizards pacing around a feeding circle in a stately ritualized walk. Their tail is stuck straight out and they throw their body from side to side with exaggerated convulsions.",

      "Food/Eating Habits": "In the wild the otters eat primarily crustaceans and mollusks but will also eat fish, insects, amphibians and reptiles. Asian small-clawed otters use their forepaws rather than their mouth to locate and capture food items. Incomplete webbing between the toes gives them a great deal of manual dexterity. They have sensitive digital pads that help them feel under rocks or in murky water for food. They dig in sand and mud at the shoreline for various types of shellfish (clams and mussels) and crabs. To get at the meat, they either crush the shell by hand or let heat from the sun open the shells. Their teeth are broad and robust, well suited for crushing shells.At the Smithsonian's National Zoo, Asian small-clawed otters are fed a prepared meat diet called Natural Balance, small fish such as smelt and capelin, canned feline diet and kibble. Like domestic cats, Asian small clawed otters have a propensity to develop kidney stones, so they are given cat food which includes ingredients that prohibit the growth of these stones. They are also given crabs, mussels, clams, mealworms, crickets, live crayfish and live goldfish as enrichment items. With a very rapid metabolism, otters have boundless energy, but a meal passes through their system in just a few hours. Because of this, they are fed multiple times a day.",

      "Physical Description": "The Bennett's wallaby has mostly tawny gray fur, with a white chest and belly, and a dark brown muzzle, paws and feet. This wallaby is also known as the red-necked wallaby, because of the red-tinted fur on the back of its neck and shoulders. Bennett's is the name of the subspecies typically found in Tasmania.These animals have an acute sense of smell and hearing. Their large ears are capable of moving 180 degrees independently, allowing them to remain alert for potential predators, such as dingoes.As members of the genusMacropus, meaning \"long foot,\" Bennett's wallabies are closely related to kangaroos and wallaroos. This genus includes some, but not all, other wallaby species. Shared adaptations within this genus include highly developed hind legs, a sturdy, tapered tail that aids in balance, a forward-opening pouch with four teats, underdeveloped vocal chords and eyes set high on the skull. In general, wallabies tend to be smaller than kangaroos and wallaroos\u00a0and can be distinguished by their darker muzzle and paws.One of the macropods most identifiable traits is their unique form of locomotion. Though best known for hopping, kangaroos, wallaroos and wallabies can also crawl and swim! Hopping is their most efficient means of travel when moving at speeds greater than 9 miles per hour (15 kilometers per hour). At the end of each bounce, when the legs are bent, energy stored in the tendons contributes to extending the leg and the next bounce. This transfer of energy is similar to a pogo stick.",
      "Lifespan": "Bennett\u2019s wallabies typically live to be about 5 years old in human care, but there are reports of individuals living much longer.",
      "Food/Eating Habits": "Bennett's wallabies graze on grasses and herbs. During dry spells, roots become their primary water source.At the Smithsonian's National Zoo, these wallabies eat greens, vegetables, hay and kangaroo biscuits.",

      "Physical Description": "Alpacas are slender-bodied animals with long legs and necks, small heads and large, pointed ears. They are covered in a soft fleece that is virtually free of guard hair and occurs in a variety of colors.\u00a0Alpacas have soft, padded\u00a0feet that leave even the most delicate grasses and terrain undamaged as they graze. The two types of alpacas are huacaya and suri.Ninety-five percent of alpacas are huacayas. Their crimpy fiber grows perpendicular to the skin, giving them a wooly appearance. Suris have straight fiber that curls toward the ground, hanging in \"dreadlocks.\" However, because of their finer, less dense coat, the suri is not quite as adept at withstanding severe weather. The suri is rarer with only about 5,000 registered in the United States.The Smithsonian's National Zoo exhibits huacaya alpaca. Alpacas have no top, front teeth. An adult male alpaca's upper and lower incisors and lower canines develop into fighting teeth or fangs that can be more than 1.2 inches (3 centimeters) long. These teeth do not develop as much in females. Aside from this difference in tooth morphology, sexual dimorphism is minimal in alpacas.",
      "Food/Eating Habits": "Alpacas are strict grazers. In their native South America, domesticated herds feed on grasses from the mountainsides and valleys of the Andes. For thousands of years, alpacas have lived where grass grows sparsely, and they require much less food than most animals their size. In human care, alpacas usually feed on a combination of fresh grass and low-protein hay. The Zoo's huacaya alpaca are fed mixed grass and herbivore feed.",
      "Social Structure": "Alpacas are social herd animals, and their only defense is flight. As they feel safest in numbers and have such strong herding instincts, it is best not to have just one alpaca. Alpacas need the companionship of at least one other alpaca to thrive.",

    "description": "Now more than ever, we need your support. Make a donation to the Smithsonian's National Zoo and Conservation Biology Institute today!",
    "traits": {
      "Physical Description": "Asian elephant skin is gray, but parts sometimes lack color, especially on and around the ears, forehead and trunk. This de-pigmentation is believed to be controlled by genetics, nutrition and habitat, and generally develops as an elephant ages. Brownish to reddish hair covers the bodies of young elephants. The amount of hair reduces with age, and the color darkens.Elephant skin varies from paper thin in some places, such as on the inside of the ears, to as thick as 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) in other places, such as around the back. Despite its thickness, the skin is sensitive due to\u00a0a rich nerve supply. Elephants protect their skin from the sun and bugs by regularly covering themselves with dirt, sand and mud. Their large ears function as cooling devices. The ears\u00a0contain\u00a0many blood vessels. As an elephant\u00a0flaps its\u00a0ears on hot days, the blood in these veins cools, which then cools the elephant's\u00a0brain and travels back through the body, reducing body temperature by several degrees.An elephant's brain is large, weighing between 9 and 13 pounds (4 and 6 kilograms). Elephants are thought to be highly intelligent animals, and they have a great capacity to learn. In fact, much of their behavior is learned behavior rather than instinctive behavior.Unlike other mammals, where the legs are in an angular position, the elephant's legs are stacked in an almost vertical position under the body. This positioning, along with the detailed anatomy of their long bones, provides a strong support for the animal's great weight. The vertical position of the limbs allows the elephant to remain standing for long periods without expending much energy. It also allows elephants to sleep while standing, as well as while lying down.In most mammals, the bones contain a narrow cavity. In elephants, this cavity is lacking. Instead, a network of dense perforated bone occupies the space, which makes the bones stronger and able to withstand more pressure. The elephant's skeleton is designed for mobility as well as strength. An elephant must have physical structures and coordinated muscular and neurological systems to accomplish survival skills, such as\u00a0standing on their rear legs and climbing up and down steep slopes.Elephants actually walk on their toes and have a thick, fibrous pad on the bottom of each foot. This pad acts as a shock absorber, protecting the leg and toe bones from jarring under its weight and cushioning each step.The trunk is a fusion of the nose and upper lip. It contains no bones, but is composed of muscles, blood and lymph vessels, nerves, little fat, connective tissues, skin, hair and bristles. Cartilage is found only at the base of the trunk, dividing the nostrils. The trunk has about 150,000 muscle units and tendons that provide the elephant precision, as well as strength of movement. These often tiny muscle units tend to be arranged radially or longitudinally\u00a0and, by acting against one another, allow the trunk to be moved in any direction. Although delicate in its movements, the trunk is also a very powerful organ that can lift heavy objects with ease.Asian elephants have one small projection at the end of their trunk, called a \"finger,\" which aids with precision. Elephants use their trunks to take up water and squirt it into their mouths. The trunk is capable of performing many other functions as well, including\u00a0feeding, snorkeling, dusting, smelling, sifting, sorting, touching, sound production and communication, lifting, pushing, defense and offense. It can hold about 2 gallons (7.57 liters) of water. Senses of smell and touch are very important for elephants. Their\u00a0trunks help them \"know\" their world.Asian elephants have six sets of teeth, all six of which are present in the skull at birth. They are, however, very small. Each successive set of teeth is larger, more complex\u00a0and lasts longer than the previous set. As a result, an elephant's skull grows throughout its lifetime to accommodate the new and ever-larger teeth. The teeth are replaced in a horizontal progression, similar to that of a conveyor belt. The worn teeth move forward, break and fall out of the mouth or are swallowed. An elephant's age can be estimated by examining molar sequence and wear.Tusks are modified upper incisors that grow throughout an individual's life at a rate of several inches\u00a0per\u00a0year. They are composed of ivory, a material\u00a0similar to bone that is made primarily\u00a0of calcium and phosphate. The tusk has a pulp cavity containing nerve tissues. In an adult animal, about two-thirds of the tusk is visible while the remaining one-third is embedded in the socket, or sulcus, in the cranium.Newly developing tusks have a conical cap of smooth enamel that eventually wears off. Not all elephants develop visible tusks; in the Asian species, only some males have large, prominent tusks. Most female and some male Asian elephants have small tusks, called tushes, which seldom protrude more than an inch or two from the lip line. Tushes\u00a0have\u00a0a slightly different composition than tusks. They are small and brittle, causing them to easily break. A significant number of adult male Asian elephants are tuskless. The percentage of males with tusks varies by region, with less than 10 percent in Sri Lanka to approximately 90 percent in India. This disparity may be a reflection of the intensity of past ivory hunting.In the African elephant species, generally, but not always, both the males and females have tusks. Tusks are extremely useful, multipurpose instruments. Elephants use them to\u00a0dig for water, salt, minerals and roots; to debark trees; as levers to manipulate objects in their environment; for rescuing calves; for threat displays; as weapons for defense and offense; as trunk rests; and as protection for the trunk.",
      "Lifespan": "Longevity of elephants is not well understood, and most of the available information comes from African elephants. Recent data suggests that African elephants rarely live to the age of 50.\u00a0Evidence suggests that Asian elephants typically live into their mid-50s, but there is not enough consistent data available on wild Asian elephants to accurately estimate their lifespan. Median life expectancy\u00a0for female Asian elephants is 47 years old.",
      "Food/Eating Habits": "Asian elephants are herbivores and spend about three-quarters of each day eating or moving toward a food or water source. Feeding is not continuous, with three principal feeding bouts in the early morning, afternoon and night. Elephants tend to rest and nap during the hottest hours of the day. They feed primarily on grasses\u00a0but also consume large amounts of browse, including\u00a0leaves, roots, vines, twigs, shoots and bark, as well as fruit. Cultivated crops such as bananas and sugar cane are also a favored food, placing them in conflict with farmers. Foraging herds can be very destructive to cropland or forest, because they are capable of pushing down large trees in order to gather their foliage and bark. Elephants only assimilate about 44 percent of what they eat. Therefore, they must consume great amounts of food, about 165 to 330 pounds (74 to 150 kilograms) per day and about 50 gallons (189 liters) of water per day in the wild. A very large male might eat twice that amount.The elephants at the Smithsonian's National Zoo are fed throughout the day to simulate their natural feeding pattern. Their diets are individually tailored to each animal's needs, taking into account health, age, activity level and metabolism. A typical diet for an adult female elephant could total about 135 pounds, consisting of about two-and-a-half bales of hay (each bale weighs about 45 pounds or 20 kilograms), 8 pounds of elephant chow\u00a0(an alfalfa-based pellet that is nutrient dense, providing protein, vitamins and minerals), 2 pounds each of bran and oats, and 10 pounds of fruits and vegetables, including sweet potatoes, carrots\u00a0and apples. Apple fiber pellets are fed as training reinforcement and browse is fed as available.",
      "Social Structure": "Asian elephants typically live in small herds of related females, their female offspring and immature males. These elephants are extremely social and form complex relationships, working together to raise their young and to protect the group. Unlike African elephants, they do not have a matriarch. However, individual females will sometimes take on a more dominant role.Male elephants typically leave the herd when they reach puberty, between the ages of 8 and 13. This is often a gradual process, driven by the males' competitive and independent nature and the females' lack of tolerance for their aggressive behavior. Young males tend to form loose bachelor herds, sometimes following female herds or foraging alone. As males age, they typically become more competitive and spend more time alone.",

      "Physical Description": "An African clawed frog's body is flattened with a smaller, wedge-shaped head. The positioning of the eyes and nostrils on the top of the head, along with camouflaged skin, help this species hide from predators, such as herons. The smooth skin is often multicolored with blotches of greenish-gray or brown on its back. The underside is off-white with a yellow hue. African clawed frogs have the ability to change their appearance to match their background, becoming darker, lighter or mottled.The frogs' front limbs are small with non-webbed fingers used to push food into the mouth. Their hind legs are large and webbed, and the three inside toes on either foot have \"claws,\" which are not true claws but cornified tips. Although an adept swimmer, the African clawed frog is clumsy on land and crawls rather than hops.African clawed frogs also have a lateral line system that is very sensitive to vibrations, enabling them to detect predators and prey in murky water. The lateral line is visible as a series of white stitch marks along each side of the frog.The Pipidae family of frogs is unique in that members lack a tongue and a visible ear. The males also lack vocal cords. Instead of moveable eyelids, a horny, transparent covering protects their eyes.",
      "Lifespan": "African clawed frogs can live up to 15 years.",
      "Food/Eating Habits": "As tadpoles, African clawed frogs are exclusively filter feeders. Adult frogs become scavengers, eating living, dead or dying arthropods and other pieces of organic waste, including aquatic insect larvae, water insects, crustaceans, small fish, tadpoles, worms and freshwater snails. They have a voracious appetite and will attack anything that passes by. Extremely sensitive fingers, an acute sense of smell and its lateral line system help to locate food. A special pump helps individuals suck food into their mouths. The claws on their\u00a0hind feet tear apart larger pieces of food.",

      "Physical Description": "Aldabra tortoises' carapace (or upper shell) has a small neck plate that is usually visible, a feature absent in other species of giant tortoises. The males have a concave plastron (belly shell) that aids in mating. They are dark gray to black in color with a highly domed, thick carapace. They have long necks, which helps with food gathering. The hind legs are cylindrical and columnar like those of an elephant; thick, often bony scales cover them. The toes are short and two-jointed. The head is relatively small, pointed and covered by scales.A rare subspecies of Aldabra tortoise has been discovered in approximately ten zoos around the United States. The Aldabra tortoises at the Reptile Discovery Center have not yet been DNA tested to determine if they fall under this category.",
      "Lifespan": "They can reach ages of more than 100 years. It is believed that tortoises are the longest lived of all animals although is hard to prove because they have outlived the scientists who were studying them, and proper records were not kept. The Aldabra tortoises on exhibit at the Smithsonian's National Zoo are about 80 years old. This is a guess because they arrived at the Zoo as adults. One pair arrived in 1956 and the second in 1976.",
      "Food/Eating Habits": "This tortoise is the largest animal on the Aldabra Island atoll. It fills a similar role to the one occupied by elephants in Africa and Asia. As with elephants, they are the main consumers of vegetation and will noticeably alter the habitat during their search for food. Tortoises have been known to knock over small trees and shrubs to obtain nutritious leaves. Seeds pass through the tortoise's digestive tract and eventually become food for many other species.Aldabra tortoises are able to go without food or water for long periods. They are grazers and browsers, feeding mainly on grasses and woody plants. However, they will eat meat when it is available and possibly even eat the carcasses of dead tortoises. They may also eat feces.At the Zoo, Aldabra tortoises eat salad and hay three days per week. In the summer, they have access to the outdoor enclosure where they graze on grass and weeds. Their diet is supplemented with cactus pad, carrots, sweet potatoes and assorted browse.",
      "Social Structure": "Aldabras are one of the more social tortoise species. Males will fight with one another for breeding rights and territory.Aldabra tortoises are easily domesticated and can learn to identify their keepers in a short time.",

They have thick bodies and powerful legs, which aid in both speed and digging. They have black, rubber-like balls on the soles of their feet.Adult African plated lizards have black or brown scales on their backs, called dorsal scales. Each dorsal scale is spotted with yellow. The plates on their heads, called head shields, are also yellow. Their throats are an off-white color, and their bellies are light brown. Juveniles are black with yellow spots on their backs and yellow stripes on the sides of their bodies.African plated lizards' dorsal scales are small with many ridges, with give them a serrated appearance. Their lower eyelids are\u00a0also covered with small scales. They have large, triangular scales on their cheeks, called tympanic shields.

In Brazil, they are known as \"pirarucu,\" a word from the Tupi language, which translates roughly as \"red fish.\" In Peru, they are known as \"paiche.\" When the rivers overflow, fish can be dispersed into the surrounding forest for miles, sometimes to remote areas where floodwater contains so much decaying vegetation that oxygen levels are too low to support most fish. This predicament does not affect the arapaima, as it has the ability to breathe air. Its gills are so small that it takes in air using a modified swim bladder that opens into the fish's mouth and acts as a lung. It can survive as long as 24 hours outside the water.",

Their tongues and sharp, bony teeth, combined with the teeth on the roof of their palates, allow them to debilitate and shred their prey. The arapaima can easily feed in low-oxygen areas where gill-breathing fish are forced to slow down. They can also use short bursts of speed to attack potential prey hitting the surface of the water. At the Smithsonian's National Zoo, their diet consists of herring, squid, smelt, shrimp, fruit and gels.",

      "Physical Description": "Band-tailed pigeons are larger and somewhat chunkier than their cousin, the rock pigeon, although both are marked by pale gray coloration. Adults have small heads, with a white crescent collar and green, scaly-looking feathers on the neck. Their backs are bluish-gray and their underbellies are purple-gray. A dark gray band stretches along the undersides of their tails. Their bills, legs and feet are yellow.",
      "Lifespan": "They can live up to 18 years.",
      "Food/Eating Habits": "Band-tailed pigeons search the forests for fruits, nuts, seeds and occasionally insects, often in large flocks outside the breeding season. They are swift fliers and agile climbers, allowing them to navigate treetops and branches with ease. They are nomadic feeders, passing through areas as food becomes plentiful or scarce, and will range up to 3 miles away from their nests to feed.",
      "Social Structure": "They are sociable birds who can often be found foraging and nesting among flocks and small groups.",

They do not have feather tufts, which are often mistaken for ears, as tufted owls do. They have heavily feathered legs with featherless feet. Like most owls, they have large eyes, allowing them to see well in their nocturnal hunting grounds. Unlike the yellow eyes of most owls, barred owls have brown eyes.",
      "Food/Eating Habits": "Barred owls will eat just about anything they can catch and kill, including\u00a0small mammals up to the size of rabbits,\u00a0 ground-dwelling birds, all manner of reptiles and amphibians, and invertebrates. They typically take prey on the ground, but have been observed chasing squirrels through tree limbs.",

      "Physical Description": "Black and rufous elephant shrews get their name for their long noses, which resemble an elephant\u2019s trunk. They have long heads, round ears, thin tails and compact bodies, with reddish fur on their heads and chests, black fur on their hind parts, and a white ring around their dark eyes. Their hind legs are slightly longer than their front legs, which gives them extra speed and agility.",
      "Lifespan": "Around 4-5 years.",
      "Food/Eating Habits": "Insectivores, but also eat fruit and seeds. They use their flexible snouts to root among the leaf litter, and scoop up beetles, centipedes, and ants with their long tongues.",
      "Social Structure": "Black and rufous elephant shrews can either be solitary or live in monogamous breeding pairs. These pairs will establish home territories and push away any rival elephant shrews that encroach on their turf.",
