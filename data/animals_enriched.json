They also eat sea birds and ducks or hunt over grasslands and marshes for small mammals such as rabbits, squirrels, prairie dogs and muskrats. Bald eagles eat carrion willingly and are notorious for robbing osprey of their catches. Eagles wait on a favorite perch for an osprey to return to its nest with a fish in its talons for its own young, and then harass the smaller raptor until it is forced to drop its prey for the eagle to retrieve. When hunting for fishes, it does not usually dive into the water like the osprey but instead searches for fish near the surface.The bald eagle's diet at the Smithsonian's National Zoo consists of rats, fish, chicken leg quarters and quail.",

The four families are the Psittaculidae (Old World parrots), Psittacidae (African and New World parrots), Cacatuidae (cockatoos), and Strigopidae (New Zealand parrots). One-third of all parrot species are threatened by extinction, with a higher aggregate extinction risk (IUCN Red List Index) than any other comparable bird group.
