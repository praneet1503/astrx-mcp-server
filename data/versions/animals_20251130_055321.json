They have powerful legs and feet that are equipped with large talons used for killing their prey.Bald eagles are opportunistic foragers but prefer fish as their primary food and are found in great densities where fish are abundant. They also eat sea birds and ducks or hunt over grasslands and marshes for small mammals such as rabbits, squirrels, prairie dogs and muskrats. Bald eagles eat carrion willingly and are notorious for robbing osprey of their catches. Eagles wait on a favorite perch for an osprey to return to its nest with a fish in its talons for its own young, and then harass the smaller raptor until it is forced to drop its prey for the eagle to retrieve. When hunting for fishes, it does not usually dive into the water like the osprey but instead searches for fish near the surface.The bald eagle's diet at the Smithsonian's National Zoo consists of rats, fish, chicken leg quarters and quail.",

The common term for this is a designer dog, in which two purebreds are crossed to produce desirable traits from both. The Chihuahua, which originated from Mexico, is a small, short-haired dog with a big, charming personality. The Poodle, which originated from Germany, comes in three sizes (Standard, Miniature, and Toy) and is known for its curly coat, keen intelligence, and athleticism. When crossed together, these two dogs can produce puppies with a wide variety of different characteristics. But owners can usually expect a Chipoo to have smooth, curly, or coarse hair of varying lengths with a brown, blue, black, white, cream, fawn, or silvery gray color.",

They have four short legs; the front legs have five toes while the back legs have only four toes. Alligators have a long, rounded snout that has upward facing nostrils at the end; this allows breathing to occur while the rest of the body is underwater. The young have bright yellow stripes on the tail; adults have dark stripes on the tail.It's easy to distinguish an alligator from a crocodile by the teeth. The large, fourth tooth in the lower jaw of an alligator fits into a socket in the upper jaw and is not visible when the mouth is closed. This does not happen in crocodiles. Alligators have between 74 and 80 teeth in their mouth at a time. As they wear down, they are replaced. An alligator can go through 3,000 teeth in a lifetime.",
      "Lifespan": "American alligators live about 50 years in the wild. After they are 4 feet long, alligators are safe from predators except humans and occasionally other alligators.",
      "Food/Eating Habits": "Alligators are carnivorous. They have very strong jaws that can crack a turtle shell. They eat fish, snails and other invertebrates, birds, frogs and mammals that come to the water's edge. They use their sharp teeth to seize and hold prey. They swallow small prey whole. If the prey is large, they shake it apart into smaller, manageable pieces. If it is very large, they will bite it, then spin on the long axis of their bodies to tear off easily swallowed pieces.At the Smithsonian's National Zoo, American alligators are fed rats and occasionally rabbits.",
      "Social Structure": "Female alligators usually remain in a small area. Males can occupy areas greater than two square miles. Both males and females extend their ranges during the breeding season. Young alligators remain in the area where they are hatched and where their mother protects them. After two to three years, they leave that area in search of food or when driven out by larger alligators.",

    "traits": {
      "Physical Description": "Tigers have reddish-orange coats with prominent black stripes, white bellies and white spots on their ears. Like a human fingerprint, no two tigers have the exact same markings. Because of this, researchers can use stripe patterns to identify different individuals when studying tigers in the wild. Tigers are powerful hunters with sharp teeth, strong jaws and agile bodies. They are the largest terrestrial mammal whose diet consists entirely of meat; the largest tiger ever recorded was an Amur tiger. The tiger's closest relative is the lion. In fact, without fur, it is difficult to distinguish a tiger from a lion.",
      "Lifespan": "The life span of tigers in the wild is usually between 10 and 15 years. In human care, or on rare occasions in the wild, a tiger can live up to 20 years. However, approximately half of all wild tiger cubs do not survive past the first two years of life. Only 40 percent of those that reach independence actually live to establish a territory and produce young. The risk of mortality remains high for adult tigers due to their territorial nature, which often results in direct competition with conspecifics, or members of the same species.",
      "Food/Eating Habits": "Tigers are ambush predators that rely on stealth and strength to take down prey. These apex predators primarily hunt large ungulates, such as wild boar and deer, but are also known to consume monkeys, buffalo, sloth bears, leopards and even crocodiles. When tigers are found in close proximity to humans, they may also feed on domestic animals, such as cattle or goats. Tigers are adept swimmers and have even been recorded hunting in the water.These powerful cats hunt primarily at night, using sight and sound to identify prey. Their striped coats help them blend into their surroundings, where they lie in wait for prey to pass by. At the opportune moment, tigers pounce on their prey, take it to the ground and finish the kill by breaking or biting the neck. Tigers hunt about once a week and consume as much as 75 pounds (34 kilograms) of food in one night.At the Zoo, tigers eat ground beef, and their diet is supplemented with enrichment items each week. They receive knucklebones or cow femurs twice a week and rabbits once a week to exercise their jaws and keep their teeth healthy.",
      "Social Structure": "Tigers in the wild are thought to be solitary creatures, except when mating or raising young. Cubs stay with their mothers until they learn to hunt successfully, usually at about 18 to 24 months old. They reach full independence after two to three years, at which point they disperse to find their own territory. Female tigers often remain near their mother's' territory, while males disperse farther from home.",

The wings and back of a breeding adult are a striking combination of gold, white and brown speckles to go with a slick of black feathers covering the face, chest and belly, as well as a white stripe across the forehead that extends to either side of the neck. Males’ coloration is usually crisper and more well-defined, with females featuring pale mottled faces.Juveniles have brown-gray plumage similar to non-breeding adults, but their wings and backs include some yellow and white speckles that can appear almost scaly.Chicks hatch covered in fluffy down with grayish-white bellies and splotches of yellow and black on their heads and backs.",

Some of these insects include adult and larval beetles, grasshoppers, wasps, ants, flies and mosquitoes. Spiders, snails, worms, mollusks and small crustaceans can also end up as a meal for this shorebird.While foraging, these birds repeat a sequence of “run-stop-peck,” in which they run to a spot, stop to look for food, peck at anything they find and repeat the process.At the Smithsonian’s National Zoo and Conservation Biology Institute, American golden plovers are fed nutritionally complete pellets, krill, mealworms and crickets.",

At their breeding grounds, American golden plovers are highly territorial and will chase off intruders that enter their large territories, which range from 25-125 acres.

    "traits": {
      "Physical Description": "North American beavers have stocky bodies with a yellow-brown to almost black coat and a broad, flat, scaly tail. Their large, orange incisors grow continuously throughout their lifetime. They have webbed rear feet and digitated front paws. The beaver's stocky body enables it to conserve heat.Beavers have long, orange, visible front teeth, called incisors. These teeth grow continuously throughout its life and are worn down through daily use. These teeth are self-sharpening and can cut a tree the size of a person's finger in a single bite! If the incisors become too long, they can prevent the beaver's mouth from closing enough for its grinding molars to meet, which could lead to starvation. Beavers' incisors appear dark orange due to the high amount of iron contained in the enamel, which is the hard outer layer of the teeth. The iron strengthens the enamel, helping prevent the teeth from breaking or cracking while the beaver gnaws.Beavers regularly move between aquatic and terrestrial environments. Their small, dexterous front feet are well adapted to working on land. They walk on five digits, grasp sticks with their front paws and have well-developed digging claws. Their larger hind feet are webbed for swimming and void of fur, except on the dorsal surface.The hind feet also have a preening toe, the second from the inside, with a unique double toenail. Beavers are meticulous groomers. They use the preening toe as a comb to prevent their fine, soft fur from matting to maintain its waterproofing and insulating properties. These flexible toes also remove burrs and parasites.On land, a beaver's movements are extremely awkward, making them vulnerable to predators. In water, however, beavers can swim up to 6 mph (10 kilometers per hour). Their oversized lungs allow them to stay submerged for up to 15 minutes while traveling over half a mile.Whiskers help detect objects around a beaver's face and head, which is especially helpful in narrow passageways and dark water. The beaver's eyes have a thin, transparent membrane, called a nictitating membrane, which is pulled over the eyeball for underwater work. A beaver's sight is good only for short distances and at close range. Its ears are external, small and rounded, with valves that also close while submerged, and the beaver's auditory sense is well developed.The shape of the tail is an individual and family trait, varying from short and broad to long and narrow. It is practically hairless and covered with black scales. There is a sharp demarcation between the fur and the scales, the fur remaining at full length and density right up to this line. The tail is used as a rudder in swimming, as a balance prop while working on land and to signal danger when slapped on the water. Beavers will also store fat in their tails, eating more in the fall so they can survive off the fat stored in their tails through winter if food is not available. The beaver's vertebrae continue into and almost to the end of the tail.",
      "Lifespan": "North American beavers typically live 10 to 12 years. The oldest on record lived 30 years in human care.",
      "Food/Eating Habits": "Beavers are herbivores, eating leaves, woody stems and aquatic plants. Their chief building materials are also their preferred foods: poplar, aspen, willow, birch and maple.In cold climates, they spend the winter inside their lodge chamber, feeding on branches they have stored on the muddy pond floor as a winter food supply. The water acts as a refrigerator, keeping the stems cold and preserving the nutritional value. Beavers hold their food with their front paws, eating corn-on-the-cob style.At the Smithsonian's National Zoo, they eat mixed vegetables, rodent chow, leafy greens and a healthy supply of wood.",
      "Social Structure": "Beavers form strong family bonds. They are social animals, and each group is made up of one breeding pair, the year's kits and the surviving offspring from the previous year, called yearlings.There may also may be one or more sub-adults, 2 years or older, of either sex from previous breeding seasons. These subadults generally do not breed.In winter, these family groups live together in their lodge and share food from the common larder (stored food supply). Their family life is exceptionally stable and is based on a hierarchy in which adults dominate yearlings and yearlings dominate kits. Physical aggression is rare and vocalizations, gestures and postures are used within the lodge to communicate issues of dominance status within the group.",

      "Lifespan": "American flamingos have a lifespan of about 40-60 years.",
      "Food/Eating Habits": "These flamingos eat algae, small seeds and aquatic invertebrates such as brine, fly larvae, shrimp and mollusks. Flamingos usually feed while wading in shallows, using their feet to stir up mud on the bottom. They put their head to the surface (so that the bill is upside-down, with the tip pointing backward) and sweeps their head from side to side.By a rapid action of the tongue, they pump water in and out of the slightly opened bill. The way in which the upper and lower parts of the bill fit together, combined with the comb-like plates on the bill's edges, make it a useful tool for sieving food from water.",

Females have more subtle plumage, with warm brown feathers all over and a dark smoky eye. Both males and females have short, pale beaks.",
      "Lifespan": "The oldest recorded American wigeon lived for 21 years. They typically live for 2-3 years in the wild.",
      "Food/Eating Habits": "Wigeons eat mainly plants and other vegetation, either in or out of the water. While feeding in ponds, lakes and salt water, they nibble on aquatic plants like the upper parts of wigeon grass (named for them), duck sedge, duckweed and cattails.Their short, sturdy bills help them pluck plants forcefully, allowing them to graze on land easier than other ducks do. They eat grasses and seeds.In the breeding season, they eat more protein, including insects and small aquatic invertebrates like caddisflies, damselflies, midges, beetles, mollusks and crawdads.",
      "Social Structure": "In the winter, they form big flocks with other waterfowl, including mallards, coots and other kinds of ducks. As spring gets closer, males begin competing for females, chasing them and threatening other males. Courtship displays include posturing and whistles. After mating, wigeons take a few weeks to molt before beginning their annual fall migration.",

      "Physical Description": "The giant panda, a black-and-white bear, has a body typical of bears. It has black fur on its ears, eye patches, muzzle, legs, and shoulders. The rest of the animal's coat is white. Although scientists do not know why these unusual bears are black and white, some speculate that the bold coloring provides effective camouflage. In patches of dense bamboo, an immobile giant panda is nearly invisible, and virtually disappears among snow covered rocky outcrops on a mountain slope. This theory does not work, however, when considering that giant pandas have no natural enemies to hide from. Another thought is that the pattern may accentuate social signals in some way, or help giant pandas to identify one another from a distance so they can avoid socializing, as they are typically a solitary animal. Another theory suggests that the black absorbs heat while the white reflects it, helping giant pandas maintain an even temperature. Unfortunately, there is no one conclusive theory as to why giant pandas are black and white.The giant panda has lived in bamboo forests for several million years. It is a highly specialized animal, with unique adaptations. The panda's thick, wooly coat keeps it warm in the cool forests of its habitat. Giant pandas have large molar teeth and strong jaw muscles for crushing tough bamboo. Many people find these chunky, lumbering animals to be cute, but giant pandas can be as dangerous as any other bear.",
      "Lifespan": "Scientists are not sure how long giant pandas live in the wild, but they are sure it is shorter than lifespans in zoos. They estimate that lifespan is about 15-20 years for wild pandas and about 30 years for those in human care. Chinese scientists have reported zoo pandas as old as 35. The Smithsonian National Zoo's Hsing-Hsing died at age 28 in 1999.",
      "Food/Eating Habits": "Millions of Zoo visitors enjoy watching giant pandas eat. A panda usually eats while sitting upright, in a pose that resembles how humans sit on the floor. This posture leaves the front paws free to grasp bamboo stems with the help of a \"pseudo thumb,\" formed by an elongated and enlarged wrist bone covered with a fleshy pad of skin. The panda also uses its powerful jaws and strong teeth to crush the tough, fibrous bamboo into bits.A giant panda's digestive system is more similar to that of a carnivore than an herbivore, and so much of what is eaten is passed as waste. To make up for the inefficient digestion, a panda needs to consume a comparatively large amount of food—from 70 to 100 pounds of bamboo each day—to get all its nutrients. To obtain this much food means that a panda must spend 10 to 16 hours a day foraging and eating. The rest of its time is spent mostly sleeping and resting.",
      "Social Structure": "Adult giant pandas may be generally solitary, but they do communicate periodically through scent marks, calls and occasional meetings. Recent research has also found that giant pandas may form communities of seven to 15 individuals within the local population.These individuals occupy a \"group\" territory, within which male home ranges overlap almost completely, while female home ranges overlap far less. Members of different \"groups\" generally avoid socializing with each other. Offspring stay with their mothers from one and a half to three years.",

      "Social Structure": "Emperor tamarins generally live in extended family groups of two to eight individuals, though there can be as many as 15 in a group. They have also been observed living in mixed-species groups with other tamarins, particularly the saddleback tamarin(Saquinus fuscicollis).

    "name": "Western lowland gorilla",
    "species": "Class:MammaliaOrder:PrimatesFamily:HominidaeGenus and Species:Gorilla gorilla gorilla",
    "description": "Now more than ever, we need your support. Make a donation to the Smithsonian's National Zoo and Conservation Biology Institute today!",
    "traits": {
      "Physical Description": "The gorilla's coat color is black. Short, thin, gray-black to brown-black hair covers the entire body except the face. Western lowland gorillas may have a more brownish coloration. A small white tuft of hair on their rump distinguishes infants up to four years old. The white patch helps the mother keep track of the infant and assists other group members in identifying the gorilla as an infant.Mature silverback males have a saddle of white hair across the small of their backs. In western lowland gorillas, the silver may extend to rump and thighs. Western lowland females may go gray below the ears and on the neck and top of the head as they age. Compared to other subspecies, western lowland gorillas have a more pronounced brow ridge and ears that appear small in relation to their heads. They also have a differently shaped nose and lip than other subspecies.Adult male gorillas' heads look conical due to the large bony crests on the top and back of the skull. These crests anchor the massive muscles used to support and operate their large jaws and teeth. Adult female gorillas also have these crests, but they are much less pronounced.In comparison to the mountain gorilla, the western lowland gorilla has a wider and larger skull, and their big toe is spread apart more from the alignment of the other four toes. Gorillas' arms are longer than their legs; when they move on all fours, they knuckle-walk, supporting their weight on the third and fourth digits of their curled hands. Like other primates, each individual has distinctive fingerprints. Gorillas also have unique nose prints.",
      "Lifespan": "In the wild, gorillas live for 30 or 40 years. In human care, gorillas may live into their 50s.",
      "Food/Eating Habits": "Gorillas are primarily herbivorous, eating the leaves and stems of herbs, shrubs and vines. They also eat the fleshy fruits of close to a hundred seasonally fruiting tree species. Other gorilla subspecies eat proportionally less fruit. Gorillas get some protein from invertebrates found on leaves and fruits. Adult male gorillas eat about 45 pounds (32 kilograms) of food per day. Females eat about two-thirds of that amount.At the Smithsonian's National Zoo, the group is fed together in the morning. Food items are cut up and spread over a wide area. In the summer, this is usually done in the yard. In the afternoon, individuals are separated so each animal gets its share of preferred food items. Morning and evening foods include chow, greens, fruits and vegetables.Forage items placed in hay for the gorillas include popcorn, sunflower seeds, peanuts, \"enrich bits,\" beans and diced fruits and vegetables. Fresh tree trimmings are given daily. Some of the gorillas favorite browse; options are Bradford pear, willow, mulberry with berries and maple.There are three feeding behaviors sometimes observed in gorillas in human care that can bother visitors. These behaviors are natural, though not to humans. They are regurgitation and reingestion, coprophagy (eating feces) and urine drinking. Regurgitation and reingestion involves an animal regurgitating some of its food and re-eating it. Biologists do not entirely understand why gorillas exhibit this behavior in human care.A few ideas include starch or sugar content, mineral recapture or the food tasting good. Provision of forage foods, increased smaller feedings and providing browse seem to reduce this behavior in some individuals. Coprophagy is seen in the wild and is defined as the eating of feces. Gorillas do not have very efficient digestive systems for a high fiber diet, so unprocessed food can be found in their feces. Coprophagy allows an animal to utilize this food. Similarly, urine drinking might be explained as the recollection of minerals.",
      "Social Structure": "Gorillas are flexible in their nature and behavior. Thus, the information found here is only a general guide.Gorillas live in groups, or troops, from two to over 30 members. But data seems to indicate that western lowland gorillas live in smaller groups, averaging about five individuals. Groups are generally composed of a silverback male, one or more black back males, several adult females and their infant and juvenile offspring. This group composition varies greatly due to births, deaths and the immigration and emigration of individuals.Mature offspring typically leave their birth group to find a mate. At about eight years old, females generally emigrate into a new group of their choosing. They seem to choose which silverback to join based on such attributes as size and quality of his home range.A female may change family groups a number of times throughout her life. When leaving their birth group, some sexually mature males may attempt to replace the silverback in an already established group. However, they usually spend a few years as bachelor males. Nevertheless, a new troop can be easily formed when one or more non-related females join a lone male.An adult, dominant, silverback males leads the group. He has exclusive breeding rights to the females though at times, he may allow other sub-adult males in the group to mate with females. The silverback mediates disputes and also determines the group's home range. He regulates what time they wake up, eat and go to sleep.All gorillas over three years of age make both day nests for resting and night nests for sleeping. Infants share their mothers' nests. Gorillas form nests by sitting in one place and pulling down and tucking branches, leaves or other vegetation around themselves. Adult males usually nest on the ground. Females may nest on the ground or in trees. Juveniles are more apt to nest in trees. Studies of western lowland gorillas have shown that the number of nests found at a site does not necessarily coincide with the number of weaned animals observed in a group.The western lowland gorilla is a quiet, peaceful and non-aggressive animal. It never attacks unless provoked. However, males do fight over females, and the new leader of a group may kill unrelated infants. This causes the females to begin cycling sooner. An adult male protecting his group may attempt to intimidate his aggressor by standing on his legs and slapping its chest with cupped or flat hands while roaring and screaming.If this elaborate display is unsuccessful and the intruder persists, the male may rear his head back violently several times. He may also drop on all fours and charge toward the intruder. In general, when they charge they do not hit the intruder. Instead, they merely pass them by. This display of aggression maintains order among separate troops and reduces the possibility of injury. It is thought that size plays an important role in determining the winner of an encounter between males, with the larger male winning.Gorillas exhibit complex and dynamic relationships. They interact using grooming behaviors, although less than most other primates. Affiliation may also be shown through physical proximity. Young gorillas play often and are more arboreal than the large adults. Adults, even the silverback, tolerate infant play behavior. He also tolerates and often participates in the play of older juveniles and black back males. Because of gorilla variability, some or all of these behaviors may or may not be seen.",

      "Food/Eating Habits": "In the wild the otters eat primarily crustaceans and mollusks but will also eat fish, insects, amphibians and reptiles. Asian small-clawed otters use their forepaws rather than their mouth to locate and capture food items. Incomplete webbing between the toes gives them a great deal of manual dexterity. They have sensitive digital pads that help them feel under rocks or in murky water for food. They dig in sand and mud at the shoreline for various types of shellfish (clams and mussels) and crabs. To get at the meat, they either crush the shell by hand or let heat from the sun open the shells. Their teeth are broad and robust, well suited for crushing shells.At the Smithsonian's National Zoo, Asian small-clawed otters are fed a prepared meat diet called Natural Balance, small fish such as smelt and capelin, canned feline diet and kibble. Like domestic cats, Asian small clawed otters have a propensity to develop kidney stones, so they are given cat food which includes ingredients that prohibit the growth of these stones. They are also given crabs, mussels, clams, mealworms, crickets, live crayfish and live goldfish as enrichment items. With a very rapid metabolism, otters have boundless energy, but a meal passes through their system in just a few hours. Because of this, they are fed multiple times a day.",
      "Social Structure": "This is a social species, living in family groups of up to 15 to 20 individuals. Although they live in groups, they hunt by themselves.",

      "Physical Description": "The Bennett's wallaby has mostly tawny gray fur, with a white chest and belly, and a dark brown muzzle, paws and feet. This wallaby is also known as the red-necked wallaby, because of the red-tinted fur on the back of its neck and shoulders. Bennett's is the name of the subspecies typically found in Tasmania.These animals have an acute sense of smell and hearing. Their large ears are capable of moving 180 degrees independently, allowing them to remain alert for potential predators, such as dingoes.As members of the genusMacropus, meaning \"long foot,\" Bennett's wallabies are closely related to kangaroos and wallaroos. This genus includes some, but not all, other wallaby species. Shared adaptations within this genus include highly developed hind legs, a sturdy, tapered tail that aids in balance, a forward-opening pouch with four teats, underdeveloped vocal chords and eyes set high on the skull. In general, wallabies tend to be smaller than kangaroos and wallaroos and can be distinguished by their darker muzzle and paws.One of the macropods most identifiable traits is their unique form of locomotion. Though best known for hopping, kangaroos, wallaroos and wallabies can also crawl and swim! Hopping is their most efficient means of travel when moving at speeds greater than 9 miles per hour (15 kilometers per hour). At the end of each bounce, when the legs are bent, energy stored in the tendons contributes to extending the leg and the next bounce. This transfer of energy is similar to a pogo stick.",
      "Lifespan": "Bennett’s wallabies typically live to be about 5 years old in human care, but there are reports of individuals living much longer.",
      "Food/Eating Habits": "Bennett's wallabies graze on grasses and herbs. During dry spells, roots become their primary water source.At the Smithsonian's National Zoo, these wallabies eat greens, vegetables, hay and kangaroo biscuits.",
      "Social Structure": "Bennett's wallabies are solitary, although groups of up to 30 individuals may congregate to feed. These groups are not well defined and frequently change.",
